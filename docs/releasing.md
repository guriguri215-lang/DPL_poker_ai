# Publish a GitHub prerelease

[Back to the documentation index](README.md).

This maintainer checklist covers the complete GitHub-only publication path for
`0.1.0a6`. It does not publish to PyPI or any other package index. Stop the
publication process whenever an identity, CI, review, asset, checksum, manifest,
or safety check does not match this checklist.

## 1. Update and review the version

- Start a focused `agent/...` branch from the latest `main`.
- Set the current project version in `pyproject.toml` to `0.1.0a6`.
- Update only current-version workflow defaults, public examples, tests, and
  artifact names. Preserve historical descriptions of earlier alpha releases.
- Run the release documentation contract test so the project version, workflow
  defaults, examples, and exact asset names cannot drift independently.
- Confirm that the release changes do not alter the runtime wheel payload,
  entry points, dependencies, CLI behavior, solver, action vocabulary, CFR
  defaults, DPL schema, RunManifest schema, Phase 6, Gate B, or explanation
  layer except for required version metadata.

## 2. Merge through a reviewed pull request

- Push the branch and open a pull request against `main` with the intended
  release notes and validation results.
- Wait for every required check to pass. Confirm that all review conversations
  are resolved and that the pull request is mergeable.
- Merge to `main` only after those conditions hold. Do not bypass a required
  check or unresolved conversation.
- After the merge, wait for the CI run on the resulting `main` commit to finish
  successfully. Use that exact commit for the tag; stop if `main` moves before
  the tag and re-establish the identity checks.

## 3. Create the existing-format tag

The repository uses a lightweight tag whose name is the version without a `v`
prefix. From the verified `main` commit:

```text
git tag 0.1.0a6
git push origin 0.1.0a6
```

Confirm that `0.1.0a6`, the project version, and the tagged commit agree. Never
move, replace, or delete an existing branch, tag, or release.

## 4. Manually approve and run the release workflow

- In GitHub Actions, select the existing **Release artifacts** workflow and
  explicitly choose **Run workflow** from `main`.
- Review the manual inputs before approving the dispatch: both `tag` and
  `expected_version` must be exactly `0.1.0a6`.
- Wait for the Ubuntu build and Windows verification jobs to succeed. The
  workflow must report that the tag points at the requested source, both clean
  builds are reproducible, archive smoke checks are offline, and the final
  four-file internal bundle passes verification.
- Download the one workflow artifact from that run. Do not combine files from
  different runs or builds.

Verify the downloaded internal bundle with the checkout's existing Python. This
reads files only; it performs no network access, installation, `pip` invocation,
archive extraction, or archive-contained code execution:

```text
python scripts/verify_release_bundle.py \
  --bundle <workflow-bundle-directory> \
  --expected-version 0.1.0a6
```

## 5. Check the exact publication set

The prerelease may receive only these four files from that one unchanged
workflow bundle:

- `poker_xai-0.1.0a6-py3-none-any.whl` from `dist/`
- `poker_xai-0.1.0a6.tar.gz` from `dist/`
- `artifact-manifest.json` from `evidence/`
- `SHA256SUMS` from `evidence/`

Do not regenerate, edit, rename, or re-checksum an asset after workflow
verification. `SHA256SUMS` must name exactly the wheel, sdist, and
`artifact-manifest.json`; it must not name itself. GitHub's automatic source
archive links are not uploaded assets and are outside this four-asset contract.

Immediately before publishing, inspect only the tracked pull-request diff, pull
request body, release notes, and these four planned assets. If a non-public
value, personal information, credential material, authentication value, or
local absolute path is detected, stop before push, merge, tag, or release as
applicable. Report only the issue category and affected filename; do not display
or save the matched value. Do not investigate or rewrite repository history.
Any remediation that requires history changes needs explicit human approval.

The release notes must identify the maintainer runbook, flat four-asset
re-verification, the release documentation contract test, and the exact
four-asset contract. They must also state that runtime CLI, dependencies,
solver, DPL, and RunManifest behavior did not change. Preserve the limitation
that the normal river adapter handles only facing-all-in decisions and that its
40 CFR+ iterations are a fixed alpha computation budget, not a convergence
guarantee.

Create a GitHub prerelease for tag `0.1.0a6` and attach only the four verified
files above.

## 6. Re-download and verify the published assets

Download the four uploaded assets from the new GitHub Release into a new, empty
directory. Confirm that the directory contains no additional file or
subdirectory, then run the same verifier in flat-layout mode from the source
checkout:

```text
python scripts/verify_release_bundle.py \
  --bundle <fresh-release-download-directory> \
  --layout flat \
  --expected-version 0.1.0a6
```

The flat mode enforces the same filenames, exact checksum targets and digests,
manifest version and artifact list, reproducibility result, offline smoke
result, smoke mode, surfaces, and checks as the internal workflow-bundle mode.
It is read-only and does not install or execute either archive.

If the published download differs, stop. Do not replace assets, move the tag,
or delete and recreate the release. Record only the failure category and
affected filename, and obtain explicit maintainer direction before any further
publication action.
